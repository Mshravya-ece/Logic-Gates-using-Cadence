# Logic-Gates-using-Cadence

In this project the objective is to design and simulate schematic view of logic gates: NAND, NOR, OR, AND, EXOR, 3bit AND.

This part of the design flow includes the following steps:

•	Create circuit schematics

•	Create the symbol view

•	Create simulation test-benches

NAND gate
